title: 'How to contribute'
---

<p>There are multiple ways to contribute, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Use the <a href="/docs/patterns">existing patterns</a> and share your research about 
		how well (or not) they worked within your service for it's users.
	</li>
	<li>
		If you have patterns in your service which you believe will benefit others 
		within DWP. You can <a href="/docs/about/submit">submit a pattern or research</a> for 
		consideration.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="github-community">Github community</h2>

<p>All the content and code for this pattern library is in the open on our <a href="https://github.com/paulmsmith/dwp-design">Github repository</a>.</p>

<p>Within github you can ask questions (known as 'issues'), raise defects or create 'pull requests' for small things such as bug fixes right the way through to new pattern documentation or components.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installing the application</h2>

This pattern library is powered by a customised open source software application called 'Fractal'. To be able to contribute a pattern or component directly to this library, first you will will need to install the DWP instance of the fractal application by following the instructions below.

<h3 id="installation-requirements">Requirements</h3>

<p>To install the pattern library on your computer (known as installing it 'locally') you will need to have administrative privileges (known as 'admin rights') and you should have the following dependancies already installed.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Node - Latest LTS version (currently v6.9.1) with NPM (<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Download Installer</a>)</li>
	<li>A <a href="http://github.com">github.com</a> account</li>
	<li>Git (<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">Installing Git Instructions</a>)</li>
	<li>Yarn (<a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install">Installation Yarn instructions</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Installing these is slightly beyond the scope of this documentation as it depends on what operating system you use but if you get stuck, feel free to ask in the <a href="http://dwpdigital.slack.com">DWP Digital Slack</a>.</p>

<h3 id="installation-step-1">Step 1 - Fork the repository</h3>

<p>You will need to sign into your github account and then 'fork' the DWP-Design repository.</p>

<p>Click the 'fork' button <img src="/images/content/about/install/fork.png" alt="" class="dib dib--vam"> at the top of the page. Once clicked you will see a loading screen and then your fork will be ready.</p>

<h3 id="installation-step-2">Step 2 - Clone the code to your computer</h3>

<p>In github you will now have your own copy of the code to work with. Go to that page, the URL will be similar to:</p>

`http://github.com/username/dwp-design` 

<p>Near the top of the page is a button to 'clone or download' <img src="/images/content/about/install/clone.png" alt="" class="dib dib--vam"> the code to your computer.</p>
